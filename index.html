        <h1>Project On Console</h1>

        <p>You can use Visual Studio with many programming languages. Compared to the predecessor "Brackets" It has a 
            new layout an is much more easy. You can use it the same way you did with brackets. The examples of coding
            languages are : Html , Css , Javascript , C++. It has a simple console with a debug function that can help you with coding your
            programs. Not to mention you can host your projects in github or local sources. You can customize your whole layout with different themes
            and layout of the application. Maybe you can next time use this to create programs.
        </p>

            <h1><strong>Use Control Shift + I</strong></h1>
            <h3>After you have opened the log you can now click the console section. Then you can see all the commands and the work.
                You maybe have also seen some numbers and my name. Those are just some calculations you can see. You may see the equations in the code.
